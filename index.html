	<h1>Hi there, this is Surgie's gaming notes!</h1>
</div>

<h2>Things I'd like to do for the blog:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>remove links from desktop to a 'to sort' post</li>
    <li>Reduce duplication in 52 Games Posts?</li>
    <li>Best way to categorize hearthstone posts that aren't a class? add a new 'general' category? select posts that only have 'hearthstone' and nothing else?</li>
    <li>52 Games automatically counting up items in category? related to previous</li>
    <li>Class images for mulligan guides</li>
    <li>Mulligan / Strategy layout type?</li>
    <li>What would be cool is a list of 9 buttons and click on one that just shows that class... remove visual clutter!</li>
    <li>Any way to tag hearthstone posts as boomsday patch, etc?</li>
</ul>
