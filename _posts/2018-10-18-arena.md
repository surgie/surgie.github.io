# Dual Class Arena Notes

```
FIRST-class pick advice in dual-class mode (~400k match data): Priest > Druid > Paladin > Hunter / Rogue / Mage > Warlock > Warrior / Shaman

SECOND-class pick advice in dual-class mode (1M+ matchdata): Mage / Warlock > Rogue / Druid > Paladin / Hunter > Priest >> Shaman >> Warrior

```
Avoid picking warlock, rogue, and mage first... best hero powers, so don't want to miss on them!

(Druid / Shaman) + Warlock are good combinations... end up zooey
