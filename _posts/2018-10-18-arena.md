# Kripp's Guide to Arena

```
Seriously though, great video. Rough summary:

- Occasional high-win runs are better than consistent mediocre runs.
- Pick the best class (check HSreplay).
- Use a draft assistant (HearthArena plug).
- First 10 cards: Pick the best cards (good stats, hard removal, weapons). Don't worry about synergy.
- Second 10 cards: Usually pick the best cards, but consider synergy/archetype.
- Last 10 cards: Fill in the gaps.
- Shoot for ~six 2-drops, ~five 3-drops.
- Additional low-cost cards can compensate for lack of high-cost cards (e.g. two 2-drops vs one 4-drop).
- Avoid too many 6+ mana cards, since you can't play 2 of them on the same turn.
- Play stats/tempo. Avoid card draw unless you don't have a better play.
- Board clears are good at creating value/card advantage but often don't swing initiative by themselves.
- If you're running out of cards...go face.
- Be aware of frequently-drafted/played cards (again, HSreplay).
- Expect crazy decks at high wins. Take more risks, e.g. mulligan aggressively for early drops/win conditions.

# Dual Class Arena Notes

```
FIRST-class pick advice in dual-class mode (~400k match data): Priest > Druid > Paladin > Hunter / Rogue / Mage > Warlock > Warrior / Shaman

SECOND-class pick advice in dual-class mode (1M+ matchdata): Mage / Warlock > Rogue / Druid > Paladin / Hunter > Priest >> Shaman >> Warrior

Avoid picking warlock, rogue, and mage first... best hero powers, so don't want to miss on them!

(Druid / Shaman) + Warlock are good combinations... end up zooey
