## Mulligan

druid - WG, Saronite

hunter - WG, Saronite, Whispering Woods

mage - WG, Saronite
    - swipe with above

paladin - WG, Spreading Plague
    - swipe with above

priest - WG, Saronite

rogue - WG, Spellstone
    - saronite with above

shaman - WG, Spreading Plague OR Nourish

warlock - WG, Saronite

warrior - WG, UI, Nourish

## Strategy

Keep Spellstone, Wild Growth, Oaken, maybe PotW against Aggro, probably Nourish. You don't want Wispering Woods until you can combo it off with Soul, unless you're absolutely sure they have no AOE (even fast decks run stuff like FoK and Dreadlord)--so basically only against Paladin. Against Control I would even consider keeping UI.

Only three types of decks can remove your Soul of the Forest board cleanly--Control/Evenlocks, Warriors running Warpath, and Control Priests. Even if you don't follow up with a Savage Roar in the next two turns, your opponent will try their hardest to play around it. Use that to your advantage.

I usually try to get one token builder (whispering woods / tutor / the mana crystal one) OR oaken summons. Almost everything else is either a wide buff or draw to get to those cards. Definitely throw back tyrant, and usually nourish unless you have a shit hand otherwise
