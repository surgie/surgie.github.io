## Mulligan

```
Mulligan: For the most part it’s safest to assume your opponent is playing an aggro deck unless it’s Warrior. Against aggro I’m looking for a 2 drop and if so then secondarily one of my clear pieces (preferably Pyro/Equality as you don’t want to be stuck with a 6 mana clear when the Hunter drops a full Spellstone on turn 4).
```

4 drops are the tricky point on whether to keep or not.

Druid
- Corpsetaker
- Glass Knight
- 2 Drops
- Equality
- Val'anyr (with coin)

Hunter
- 2 drops (Ooze, Amani)
- Corpsetaker
- Blessing of Kings (with coin)

Mage
- Amani Berzerker, Ooze
- Truesilver Champion
- Corpsetaker

Paladin
- 2 drops
- Buffs
- Consecration

Priest
- Corpsetaker
- Blessing of Kings
- 2 drops

Rogue
- Amani Berzerker
- Chain Gang
- Truesilver
- Consecration

Shaman
- Probably 2 drops, truesilver, consecration and assume even shaman

Warlock
- Equality (beats even)
- 2 drops
- Corpsetaker
- Truesilver

Warrior
- Val'anyr
- Corpsetaker
- Blessing of Kings

## Strategy

```
Biggest tip is to make sure you have a good turn 4 play, sticking corpsetaker or glass knight is incredibly powerful against anything, push more damage to face than you think you should against control, especially priest you pretty much hit face with everything and then burn them out when they scream with avenging wrath.
```

Druid
- We are the beatdown
- Best plan is going tall unless we have equality/conc going into plague turn
- Don't be shy of hitting their face with weapons


Druid / Quest Rogue -> Pure Smorc

Zoo / Odd Rogue -> Control

Hunter -> Fluid

Priest -> Rush down, avoid overplaying into spirit lash
