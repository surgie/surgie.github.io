## Strategy

Druid
- We are the beatdown
- Best plan is going tall unless we have equality/conc going into plague turn
- Don't be shy of hitting their face with weapons


Druid / Quest Rogue -> Pure Smorc

Zoo / Odd Rogue -> Control

Hunter -> Fluid

Priest -> Rush down, avoid overplaying into spirit lash
