## Druid

## Hunter

[How do we build Hybrid Hunter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/acg61o/i_gonna_axe_you_a_question_how_do_we_build_hybrid/)

```
We DON'T want to draw a 2 mana 6/5 on turn 8
We want to draw Zul'jin
If we do stuff to make us less likely to draw Zul'jin or Rexxar, that's bad
Part of the power of this deck is that we thin our deck so fast, we always hit one of them
Dire Frenzy is counterproductive to that strength
Besides being a shitty BoK on a condition.

If you have Spellstone you always keep Spellstone.
I think there are two cards you always keep, Master's Call and Spellstone.

### Control Priest

```
Proactive Cards for slower matchups: Alex & Anduin, Cleric, Twilight Drake (vs. Priest)
Reactive: Twilight Acolyte vs Evenlock, Duskbreaker vs. Aggro, Scaleworm vs Odd Rogue.
- Cleric with Shield can be okay, also okay on play vs. odd rogue.

Unless taking Mind blast loses you the game on the spot, take mind blast. 
Taking Scream on turn 2 against Hunter is a mistake.

BE MORE AGGRESSIVE... you can't outvalue Rexxar. Scream is best against Even Paladin because of lack of card draw.

Just want to Alex => Double Mind Blast + Holy Fire ASAP. Taking MB off Shadow Visions helps that more than 3 mana draw a card (by picking PW:Shield).

SOMETIMES Holy Fire is better, for example in the mirror or against Hunter if we'd die otherwise.

Mindset needs to be: Control the Face! Too much chip healing in the game right now to do otherwise.

This is more MIND BLAST Priest than Control Priest.

## Shaman

> I've been beating up evenlock for two months straight now, I think navigating this MU is key to climb to legend without much trouble. 
> I commit nothing on the board early, I just wanna be able to deal with an early moutain giant and nothing more. 
> And I let them work themselves for their 7-7, I only start hitting face when I can maintain pressure over several turns. 
> An evenlock was my last boss, who by turn 9 had played both giants (first one turn 3), a twilight drake (t4) and both 7/7, but died at 9 health on t10 to a buffed al'akir :)
