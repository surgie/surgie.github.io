> I've been beating up evenlock for two months straight now, I think navigating this MU is key to climb to legend without much trouble. 
> I commit nothing on the board early, I just wanna be able to deal with an early moutain giant and nothing more. 
> And I let them work themselves for their 7-7, I only start hitting face when I can maintain pressure over several turns. 
> An evenlock was my last boss, who by turn 9 had played both giants (first one turn 3), a twilight drake (t4) and both 7/7, but died at 9 health on t10 to a buffed al'akir :)
