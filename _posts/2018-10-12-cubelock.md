## Strategy

Generally - Don't tap much past turn 2, certainly not as much as Zoo or Even taps!

Turn 5 Skull into Turn 6 Cube a Doomguard + Dark Pact is best play.

Tap turn 2 (and 3 without coin) for Giant on turn 4 is backup play.

Don't wait until turn 7 for Lackey + Dark Pact... just drop it naked on 6.
