# Initial Steps

[Five Steps After The Tutorial](https://eternaltitans.com/a-rockpackers-guide-for-new-players/)
1. Gauntlet until Master rank (chest at each level)
1. Never buy packs
    - Especially with gold! Use it on "Rare Drafting" (pick highest rarity cards), better evn with 0 wins.
2. Campaigns - Tale of Horus Traver + Dead Reckoning > Jekk's bounty by a mile
3. Forge until mastered, then Rare Drafts

# Draft

[Drafting 101 Part 2 - Building the Deck](https://rngeternal.com/2017/09/28/drafting-101-part-2-building-the-deck/)

## Priority During Draft

1. Bomb legendary/rare cards
2. Premium removal (Deathstrike)
3. Premium weapons (Elder's Feather, Whip Chain, Valkyrie Wings)
4. Evasive Units / Fliers
5. Generally strong cards

## Deck Building

Power Thresholds: 1-2, 3, 4, 5+

- 1-2: 7 relevant power plays, 8 to 12 in a perfect world... e.g. 2/2 for 2, cheap removal
- 4: 3-4 four cost cards
- 5: 3-5 five+ cost cards

Example normal curve:
- 7-12 1-2 cost cards
- 5-9 3 cost cards
- 3-4 4 cost cards
- 3-5 5+ cost cards
- 17ish power

Expensive Curve: 19 or MAYBE 20 power... need card draw + early defensive tools to pair with this

Aggro Curve: 15 or 16 power.... take advantage of mulligan to guarantee two power

# Notes

## Mulligan

- For hyper aggro decks, 2-3 power and units on 2 of first 3 turns is goal.
- Otherwise 3 is probably minimum (Power Searches < 2 cost included)
- 4 power cards in slower decks

## Play

- Make your attacks before playing dudes, so they have less info.
