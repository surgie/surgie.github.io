## Mulligan (General)
- Against aggressive tempo decks, have to keep low cost cards to try and keep up
- Against value decks, okay to get greedy and keep a high value minion (e.g. big dragon to ensure dragon synergies).
- If going 1st, keeping double 2 drop or double 3 drop is less valuable than with the coin.
    - Also probably don't want to keep 4 mana or greater minions

## Whose the Beatdown?
Identify whether or not you are the beatdown on every turn... Determines if you should play for tempo or play for value. Closely related to hand size, health, upcoming combo turns, etc.
- The beatdown wants to increase tempo, hit face, etc.
- The control wants to extract value, slow the game down, make trades, etc.

## Turn Playbook

### On Your Turn
0. Who must trade?
    - Do you 'want' to trade, but your opponent 'must' trade? Then go face!
1. Do I have lethal this turn? next turn?
2. Am I ahead or behind on board position?
    1. If behind, probably need to play less efficiently to gain tempo
    2. If ahead, make most efficient trades possible, use hero ability, don't overextend against AOE
3. Am I ahead or behind on cards?
    1. If behind on cards, should make efficient trades and play for value (e.g. using hero power)
    2. If ahead on cards, can be less efficient to gain tempo
4. Is there a likely AOE or Swing play from my opponent's next turn I should be playing around?
5. If my line of play involves drawing a card, do that first if possible.
6. If I have a play with a random component, do that next if it will impact later plays

### While opponent is playing his turn
1. How much mana will I have next turn?
2. What cards can I play?
3. Can I use my hero power together with some of them?
4. Am I likely to have lethal damage to finish the game?
5. Am I ahead or behind in cards?

### In general, keep track of:
* What would be the best card my enemy could have to respond here?
* Is this a good time for my enemy to AOE?
* If my enemy had removal, would he use it on one of my minions now?
    * e.g. If he runs multiple small minions into one of your big minions, he didn't have good removal... so safe to play next big threat.
* If you see your opponent playing mostly cards drawn later in the game, then assume the earlier cards were situational or large mana cost cards

## General Advice
consider every possibility, even the bullshit ones... eventually muscle memory will let you ignore bad ones quickly

stock mana theory - using the most mana excluding hero power probably wins

## Trade Or Face?

If it is a trade your opponent will want to make anyways, go face.

Don't throw away a 3/3 to protect another 3/3.

## Amodeus Notes

### Tempo
- Doing more with your mana (efficient minions, cheap spells)
- Requires spending more cards, and consequently needs draw power

### Value
- Used to gain card advantage, e.g. by healing minions
- If I use 20 cards in a midrange deck to deal with 30 cards from aggro deck, I have greater value (but maybe not the time to exploit that)

### Hero Power
- Used to gain value at the cost of tempo

### Choosing Between Tempo and Value

If you have significant card advantage, you can spend cards less efficiently to gain tempo.
- Play more minions to try and advance your position

If you are ahead on board, but behind in card advantage, you should make most efficient trades possible.
- In this case you want to use your hero ability, save creates, not overextend into AOE.

The game is currently skewed in favor of tempo over value, so look to see the more aggressive play.


Tempo vs Value Example - Turn 3 as Priest:
```
Tempo Play - Using a damaged 2/3 to trade with a 2/2, and then dropping a Dark Cultist 
Value Play - Healing the river crocolisk back to 2/3, to survive trading with the 2/2
```
